With the modem you can connect a monitor, a computer, a chat box or another peripheral with each other to use it in your ComputerCraft script. If you have connected a peripheral, you can wrap it with the peripheral API . 1 monitor = peripheral . wrap ( \"monitor_0\" ) So, you connected your first monitor. What now?

These aweseome hoomans helped a lot with this update! Features \u00b6 MineColonies Integration \u00b6 We added the Colony Integrator to interact with MineColonies. You can use this peripheral as pocket upgrade or as block. Integrated Dynamics Integration \u00b6 We added a peripheral to the \"Variable Store\" Block from Integrated Dynamics to read variables from integrated dynamics. This new feature is a mod integration, you can see here how you can use these new features. Storage Drawer Integration \u00b6 You can now access storage drawers. Store items, push items, pull items or does what ever you want to do with items. This new feature is a mod integration, you can see here how you can use these new features. Geo Scanner \u00b6 The Geo Scanner provides information about blocks around him and the chunk of the geo scanner. You could use it to search in the near or analyze ores in a chunk. Block Reader \u00b6 With the Block Reader you can read data of blocks and tile entites. You can simply place the blocks in front of it to access it. NBT Storage \u00b6 With this block, you're able to store tables or other values. You can simply read and write values with the functions of it. Take a look at the documentation . New Turtles Upgrades \u00b6 New powerful turtle upgrades! With this small upgrades you finally can use any tools just from turtle inventories, perform right click on blocks, collect items in small range, transport animals and much more! But be aware, the new abilities require fuel and most of them have a cooldown. Big thanks to SirEdvin who made this upgrades. New Ingame Documentation \u00b6 Advanced Peripherals does now use Patchouli to generate an ingame documentation. You can now easy get help without the need of an internet browser. Small features and improvements \u00b6 This update also provides a lot of small features and improvements New functions, events and other features \u00b6 Here is a list of some new additions Added the slot parameter to the functions of the inventory manager. Added the parameter uuid and isHidden to the chat event. Added a lot of new functions to the Player Detector . We changed some function names of the ME and RS Bridge, be warned. Added the sendFormattedMessage function to the chat box Addes russian translation by DrHesperus Improved mod integration \u00b6 You can now connect supported blocks directly with a modem. We completely removed the peripheral proxy. Support for relative and cardinal directions \u00b6 You can now use relative directions( right , left , front , bottom , ...) and cardinal directions( North , South , West , East , ...) at the same time. Example redstoneIntegrator.setOutput(\"north\", true) and redstoneIntegrator.setOutput(\"right\", true) would work. Bug fixes \u00b6 We fixed some bug fixes in 0.7r.

These aweseome hoomans helped a lot with this update! Features \u00b6 MineColonies Integration \u00b6 We added the Colony Integrator to interact with MineColonies. You can use this peripheral as pocket upgrade or as block. Integrated Dynamics Integration \u00b6 We added a peripheral to the \"Variable Store\" Block from Integrated Dynamics to read variables from integrated dynamics. This new feature is a mod integration, you can see here how you can use these new features. Storage Drawer Integration \u00b6 You can now access storage drawers. Store items, push items, pull items or does what ever you want to do with items. This new feature is a mod integration, you can see here how you can use these new features. Geo Scanner \u00b6 The Geo Scanner provides information about blocks around him and the chunk of the geo scanner. You could use it to search in the near or analyze ores in a chunk. Block Reader \u00b6 With the Block Reader you can read data of blocks and tile entites. You can simply place the blocks in front of it to access it. NBT Storage \u00b6 With this block, you're able to store tables or other values. You can simply read and write values with the functions of it. Take a look at the documentation . New Turtles Upgrades \u00b6 New powerful turtle upgrades! With this small upgrades you finally can use any tools just from turtle inventories, perform right click on blocks, collect items in small range, transport animals and much more! But be aware, the new abilities require fuel and most of them have a cooldown. Big thanks to SirEdvin who made this upgrades. New Ingame Documentation \u00b6 Advanced Peripherals does now use Patchouli to generate an ingame documentation. You can now easy get help without the need of an internet browser. Small features and improvements \u00b6 This update also provides a lot of small features and improvements New functions, events and other features \u00b6 Here is a list of some new additions Added the slot parameter to the functions of the inventory manager. Added the parameter uuid and isHidden to the chat event. Added a lot of new functions to the Player Detector . We changed some function names of the ME and RS Bridge, be warned. Added the sendFormattedMessage function to the chat box Addes russian translation by DrHesperus Improved mod integration \u00b6 You can now connect supported blocks directly with a modem. We completely removed the peripheral proxy. Support for relative and cardinal directions \u00b6 You can now use relative directions( right , left , front , bottom , ...) and cardinal directions( North , South , West , East , ...) at the same time. Example redstoneIntegrator.setOutput(\"north\", true) and redstoneIntegrator.setOutput(\"right\", true) would work. Bug fixes \u00b6 We fixed some bug fixes in 0.7r.

Example of a dirt block with a count of 85: {name=\"minecraft:dirt\", count=85} The ME Bridge can also use fingerprints to filter items exactly. Every item has its own fingerprint. You need to use the name parameter or the fingerprint parameter. If you use both, it will not break anything, but the Bridge will use the fingerprint parameter. The count parameter will always work. We have 2 parameters to filter the NBT values( nbt , json ). You can see more on them below.","title":"Item parameters of the ME"},{"location":"1.17/othersandutilities/item_parameter/#possible-informations","text":"Parameter Information Example name The name of the item (Note: this isn't the display name, it is the registry name like advancedperipherals:computer_tool ). {name=\"advancedperipherals:computer_tool\"} count The count of the item you want to get. {name=\"advancedperipherals:computer_tool\", count=48} nbt The NBT value as MD5 hash.
